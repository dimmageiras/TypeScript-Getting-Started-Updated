# TypeScript-Getting-Started-Updated

This is a forked repository for the Pluralsight course titled [_TypeScript: Getting Started_](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-getting-started/table-of-contents).
The _Initial_ branch contains code as it
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it
exists at the end of that module, except the _main_ branch which I created.

## Changes to the Updated branch

- All the npm packages are updated to the latest (had to make a tweak to the webpack.config.js).
- Changed the export to be at the end of each module and made it default when only one.
- Replaced the if statement with a ternary operator.
- Changed String interpolation to use Template strings.
- Replaced divs with semantic HTML tags.
- Enabled strict mode to TypeScript.
